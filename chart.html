                                <p class="m-b-0 m-t-20">With many new health technology companies, IoT is rapidly revolutionizing the healthcare industry. Due to lack of proper health monitoring, patient suffer from serious health issues. In the aging population and the increasing healthcare cost in hospitals are beginning to start of remote health monitoring systems. Advances in physiological sensing devices and the emergence of reliable low-power wireless network technologies have enabled the design of remote health monitoring systems. The next generation Internet, commonly referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), depicts a world populated by devices that can sense, process and react via the Internet. Thus, the intent of our work is to automate a medicine dispenser system combined with cloud based services to simulate pharmacy works. The proposed dispenser is a stand-alone tool, capable of releasing pills to the users based on the prescriptions suggested by clinicians without the need to manually visit the clinician. The methodology is found to reduce the waiting time of patients at hospitals and pharmacies and ensures privacy and independence among the patients.

                                <p>
                                Developing the automated medicine dispenser would be in terms of health parameters and frameworks, wireless communication and security issues. So, we have decided to make an internet of things based healthcare project for people who provide them all the personal information about their health on their mobile and they can check their all historical health data. The best part of this project is that it can be used by everyone and make our health management easier than available systems.</p>
